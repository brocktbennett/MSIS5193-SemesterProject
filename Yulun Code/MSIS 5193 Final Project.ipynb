For example, you might first use support to identify frequently occurring itemsets, then use confidence to find rules that have a high probability of being true, and finally use lift to find rules that represent strong associations2. It’s always a good idea to experiment with different metrics and see which ones provide the most useful and interpretable results for your specific use case."

WCSS is the sum of the squared distance between each point and its centroid. You then plot the WCSS values against the number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters is at the \"elbow\" point in the plot, where the rate of decrease in WCSS starts to diminish.

If the silhouette score for various values of k is plotted, the most optimal number of clusters will be the one with the highest average silhouette score. "
